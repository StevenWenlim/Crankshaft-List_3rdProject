# Crankshaft-List_3rdProject
This project is my project in sprint 3, which is Exploratory Data Analysis.

In this srpint i learn how to performing an exploratory data analysis to detect patterns in the data and create basic graphs.

# Project Overview

As an analyst at Crankshaft List, I was asked to determine factors that affect the vehicleâ€™s pricing using the dataset that has been collected from Crankshaft List website. By analyzing hundreds of daily vehicle ads, we expected to provide insights for our users and customers to make informed decisions when buying or selling a vehicle. The following is the conclusion that I have drawn after working on the project.

By analyzing the data, here are some findings that I obtained:
  1.	The average waiting days until car sold on Crankshaft List website it 40 days.
  2.	There is a 75% chance of selling a car within 53 days.
  3.	According to the visualization, the highest number of ads on Crankshaft List website are owned by trucks and SUVs.
  4.	Based on the observations of SUVs and trucks type, it was found that vehicles with lower odometers, better condition, and younger tend to have higher prices.
  5.	Alternatively, when considering the transmission and color of the vehicle, the price will depend on the type of vehicle.

Based on the findings, the marketing team can consider the following recommendations:
  1.	Offer pricing guidance: With an average waiting time of 40 days and a 75% chance of selling a car within 53 days, Crankshaft List can offer pricing guidance to its users to help them sell their vehicles more quickly. This can include providing data on average prices for similar vehicles, as well as offering tips on how to price a vehicle competitively.
  2.	Highlight important vehicle features: Based on the finding that vehicles with lower odometers, better condition, and younger age tend to have higher prices, Crankshaft List should encourage sellers to highlight these features in their ads. This can include providing guidance on how to take good photos of a vehicle's interior and exterior, as well as offering tips on how to highlight important maintenance and repair work.
  3.	Expand to other vehicle categories: While trucks and SUVs make up the majority of ads on Crankshaft List, the company may want to consider expanding into other types or categories. This can help to diversify the company's offerings and attract new users to the website
